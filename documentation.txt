   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install mysql-server

   For Windows:
   Download the MySQL installer from the official MySQL website (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
  
   d) Configure MySQL: Create a database named bank_db in MySQL. You can do this using a MySQL client or command line:
  
   CREATE DATABASE bank_db;

3. Build the Application: Open command prompt and navigate to the folder containing pom.xml file. Then use Maven to build the application and resolve dependencies.
  
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
